# Mini RSA



The link for the challenge:

Start the challenge 

We get a text file


![file](./img/text.png) 

Based on the name of the challange we assume a RSA cipher.

## RSA cipher:

C = m^e mod N

Decryption:
M=eâˆš(iN+C)  i = change number 


So i used a py code to run on all the possibilities (script attached)
and we get:


![result](./img/code.png)

after Decryption the text , we will get a readable text after subtract the key from the cipher letter.

picoCTF flags usually start with picoCTF, combine 2 parts {} and we done!

The flag is: picoCTF{e_sh0u1d_b3_lArg3r_aef7377d}
