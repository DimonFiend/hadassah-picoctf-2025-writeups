Start the challenge 

We get a text file


![file](./img/message.png) 

Based on the name of the challange we assume a substitution cipher.

## substitution cipher:

define a key .
shift each letter of the message by the key.

Decryption:
subtract the key from the cipher letter.

(the key is the same in cipher and decryption)

So i used dcode web to run on all 26 possibilities (script attached)
and we get:

after Decryption the text , we will get a readable text after subtract the key from the cipher letter.

picoCTF flags usually start with picoCTF, combine 2 parts {} and we done!
