From the name of the challenge I understood that I need to make an HTTP GET request.
In order to do this I used the POSTMAN application.

I copied the site's link to POSTMAN and configured a GET request but I did not receive any hint in the response from the server (see - postmanGET img).

The GET request did not work, so I decided to make a HEAD request also because of the name of the challenge.
In this HEAD request in the HEADERS I saw the flag - picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_cca66bd3} (see - postmanHEAD img). 

I put the flag on the site and finished the challenge (see - flag img).
