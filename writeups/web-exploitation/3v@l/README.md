Now you can insert malicious script since this site is sending the input stright to the eval() function but interpets it as legitimate code.

Lets see the source code of this page :

The comments pretty much revealing the vulnerabilty and the string structer we need to use in order to access the system, so lets use it.

First clue : Bypadd regex
Second clue : The flag file is /flag.txt (which means we need to access the contect of this file but I cannot use "/" or "." as mentioned in the comments of the source code)
Third clue : You might need encoding or dynamic construction to bypass restrictions. (which we see on comments in source code)

So in order to access "/flag.txt" without getting errors like this (file exstentions in this case will be detected because the use of regex so I cannot put ".txt"):

We can use the ASKII of the blacklisted chars so the input will look like this :
![INPUT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1936e62-a566-460e-8627-2fa2dd8191cb)


And thats the flag :
![FLAG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e28b6ac-4bf4-4a3b-b370-81d82dc9a91a)


Thats it :)


FLAG : picoCTF{D0nt_Use_Unsecure_f@nctions0cd8a9f1}
