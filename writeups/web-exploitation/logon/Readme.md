This is the write-up for the "Logon" challenge from picoCTF.

# The challenge

## Description

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?

## Initial look

When you open the link, youâ€™re greeted with a basic login form asking for a username and password.

I tried logging in with random credentials (like `Ibraheem / 123456`)

And surprisingly, it logged me in, but no flag appeared.

# How to solve it

At first, I thought there might be some hidden page or response based on the username or password. But after trying various combinations, nothing interesting happened.

Then I remembered the hint:  
> *"It doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's..."*

That made me think maybe the check happens **after** login, maybe via cookies?

So I opened the **Developer Tools** by pressing `F12` in Chrome, went to the **Application** tab, and looked under **Cookies** for the site.

There I found a cookie called:
```
admin=False
```

Hmm. That looks suspicious.

So I changed it to:
```
admin=True
```

Then I refreshed the page.

Then the flag was displayed!
