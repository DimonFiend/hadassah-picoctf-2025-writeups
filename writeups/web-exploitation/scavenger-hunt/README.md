By searching the web to figure out **"how to keep Google from indexing a website"**, i understood that in order to do that i should use a **Robots**. for that there must be a **robots.txt** file.
Go to **address/robots.txt** route to find the **3rd part of the flag** and a hint for the **4th part**.
![route to robots.txt](./img/route_to_robots.png)

the hint tells me the website is using an **apache server**, therefore it has a **".htaccess" configuration file**.
Go to **address/.htaccess** route to find the **4th part of the flag** and a hint for the **last part of the flag**.
![route to .htaccess](./img/route_to_htaccess.png)

the hint tells me there is some connection to **mac specific type file**.
Go to **address/.DS_store** route to find the **last part of the flag**.
