   ### ![API Page](./img/api's-page.jpg)
  
## 4.
 - We can see in the description that this method returns a memory allocation status, that might be our solution, click on the try it out button:
   ### ![Diagnose](./img/diagnosing-api.jpg)
  
## 5.
 - Now we can see the website offers us an execute button which we will inspect:
   ### ![Execute Diagnose](./img/execute-diagnose.jpg)
  
## 6.
 - We got some hidden api link for a get method which gives us a server file, we can download it straigth from the website using the Download button or visit the API link:
   ### ![Blog Website](./img/download-file.jpg)
  
## 7.
 - we got the server file which we can open in any text editor and look for whatever we need, in this case lets try to look for anything related to Pico for our solution and indeed the key is there we have found it:
